# ShrimpLang 2.0

A rewrite of the original shrimp, but hopefully done right this time.

Mild syntactic differences, if you want to check those out, you might want to take a look at the [main](main.imp) file for the basic Shrimp program (Shrimp is incomplete and this program will sometimes error!)

Currently, the main concern is making ShrimpLang 2 turning complete -- after that, comes bringing it up to spec with ShrimpLang 1

## Update, it's turing complete

It's also slower than Python. I ran a benchmark to check. This is a sad day for the Shrimp people (but also unexpected. Why'd you think I ran a benchmark!? The code is spaghetti!)
